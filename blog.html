            <h2>Difference between localStorage and sessionStorage</h2>
            <p>
              Data in LocalStorage does not expire but data in sessionStorage is
              cleared when the page session ends. localStorage capacity is
              5MB/10MB but sessionStorage capacity is 5MB.localStorage is not
              session based, need to be delete by JS or Manually but
              sessionStorage is session based.

            <h2>Difference between Global scope and Block scope</h2>
            <p>
              Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global
              Scope. Variables declared inside a { } block that is block Scope.
              Global scope's variables can be accessed from anywhere in a
              JavaScript program but Block Scope's variables can not accessed
              form outside the block

          <div class="blog_3"><h2>How Javascript Event loop work?</h2>
        <p>The event loop in JS monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. This loop constantly checks whether the call stack is empty or not and if it is, the functions waiting to be executed in the callback queue get pushed to the call stack. </p>
